<p align="justify">Dr. Hermann Koch was born in Hauswurz in Germany, on November 8th, 1954. He graduated from the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt as Dipl- Ing. in 1986 and received his PhD (Dr.-Ing.) at the same University.
His employment experience included the Hoechst AG, Frankfurt and the Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany. His special fields of interest include gas insulated high voltage technology.
Hermann Koch is a Fellow engineer of PES and has published more than 130 international papers, is author of the ‘GIL’ book of IEEE-Press published by Wiley, and co-author of the ‘Substations’ book IEEE-Press published by CRC. He holds more than 30 patent rights most of them in the field of gas insulated transmission lines. 
In IEEE Standards Association (SA) he was member of the SA Board from 2002 to 2009, chair of the PES Substations Committee 2009 to 2011 and is now member of the IEEE PES Board for Long Range Planning. He is listed in the Distinguished Lecturer Program (DLP) for gas-insulated technology

<strong>Abstract</strong>
<p align="justify">The Smart Grid of the future will have to deal with a large number of changes in the structure of the electrical power supply, with regenerative energy generation, fluctuating energy sources, distributed wind and photo voltaic in large numbers, far away new large scale generation like offshore wind farms of several Gigawatt of electric power and an increasing fleet of electric vehicles. At the same time conventional power plants will be reduced in total power and in operating time per year. 
To keep this new electric power supply stable a strong transmission backbone system is needed to interconnect wide areas of power regenerative generation and load centers. New transmission routes are required and existing routes need to be used more efficiently. A combination of overhead lines and high power underground GIL seems to be a possible solution in some cases.
Gas insulated lines (GIL) offer these high power ratings when underground solutions are necessary. GIL is not a new technology but has only been applied inside substations, power plants or tunnels in most cases. Only a few transmission lines are installed in the aspect of long distance power transmission. With this also the knowledge of functionality, design, application, cost, ecology, system integration, life time, maintenance, monitoring and other aspects are not know widely in the power engineering society.
This tutorial will give basic information to understand the function of a GIL, the requirements for a reliable operation and the application fields where GIL offers the best solution. 
The tutorial is based on a new book on GIL published by the author for IEEE through Wiley (www.wiley.com) last year which gives basic information on the gas insulated technology, design, development and applications.
